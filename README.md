IE-442 Enterprise Information Systems Modeling SQL Project

Project Overview

This project is developed for the IE-442 Enterprise Information Systems Modeling course. It focuses on Material Requirements Planning (MRP) using SQL and Python, implementing data-driven decision-making in supply chain management.

Project Structure

The project includes:

MRP_Calculations.py: SQL queries for MRP calculations

Save_MRP_Calculations.py: Stores MRP calculation results

streamlit_mrp_ui.py: Streamlit-based web application

mrp_dashboard.py: Dashboard for visualization

mrp_dashboard2.py: Alternative dashboard version

Creating_Sample: Sample data creation scripts

Documentation: Includes ER Diagram and SQL Report

README.md: Project documentation

Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, Streamlit, SQLite3)

SQL (SQLite)

VS Code for development

GitHub for version control

How to Run the Project

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/sudeff/IE-442-Enterprise-Information-Systems-Modeling-SQL-Project.git
cd IE-442-Enterprise-Information-Systems-Modeling-SQL-Project

Install Dependencies:
Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages:
pip install pandas streamlit sqlite3

Run the Streamlit App:
streamlit run streamlit_mrp_ui.py

Features

Runs MRP calculations using SQL queries

Displays results in an interactive dashboard using Streamlit

Uses SQLite for data storage and management

Supports user interaction with buttons for execution

Future Improvements

Enhancing the dashboard with more interactive visualizations

Implementing a real-time database connection instead of SQLite

Adding user authentication for secured access
